**Enable code coverage with JaCoCo | Add Below Items in POM**

```xml
<properties>
    <!-- JaCoCo Properties -->
    <jacoco.version>0.8.7</jacoco.version>
    <sonar.java.coveragePlugin>jacoco</sonar.java.coveragePlugin>
    <sonar.dynamicAnalysis>reuseReports</sonar.dynamicAnalysis>
    <sonar.jacoco.reportPath>${project.basedir}/../target/jacoco.exec</sonar.jacoco.reportPath>
    <sonar.language>java</sonar.language>
</properties>
```

These properties are used to configure various aspects of the build process and the behavior of the tools involved, such as Java version, JaCoCo version (a code coverage tool), and SonarQube analysis settings.

Here's an explanation of each property:

<java.version>11</java.version>: Specifies that the project is configured to use Java version 11.

<jacoco.version>0.8.7</jacoco.version>: Specifies the version of the JaCoCo code coverage tool to be used in the project. In this case, version 0.8.7 is specified.

<sonar.java.coveragePlugin>jacoco</sonar.java.coveragePlugin>: Specifies that JaCoCo will be used as the coverage plugin for SonarQube. This means that JaCoCo will be responsible for generating code coverage reports that SonarQube will use for analysis.

<sonar.dynamicAnalysis>reuseReports</sonar.dynamicAnalysis>: Indicates that SonarQube should reuse existing reports generated during the build process, rather than performing its own dynamic analysis.

<sonar.jacoco.reportPath>${project.basedir}/../target/jacoco.exec</sonar.jacoco.reportPath>: Specifies the path to the JaCoCo coverage report file. This file is typically generated during the build process and contains information about code coverage.

<sonar.language>java</sonar.language>: Indicates that the project's primary language is Java. This is used by SonarQube to properly analyze the code.

## SonarQube For NodeJs
To enable code coverage analysis for a Node.js-based application in SonarQube, you'll typically use a combination of tools to generate coverage reports and the SonarScanner to integrate those reports with SonarQube. Here are the general steps:

### Prerequisites:

1. **Install SonarQube:**
   - Make sure you have SonarQube installed and running.

2. **Install SonarScanner:**
   - Install the SonarScanner tool on your machine. You can find instructions in the official SonarScanner documentation.

3. **Setup Node.js Project:**
   - Ensure your Node.js project uses a testing framework that supports coverage reporting, such as Mocha, Jest, or Istanbul.

### Steps:

1. **Install Coverage Reporting Tool:**
   - Install a code coverage tool for your Node.js project. For example, you can use Istanbul, which is commonly used for this purpose. Install it as a development dependency:

     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev nyc
     ```

2. **Run Tests with Coverage:**
   - Modify your test script in `package.json` to include coverage. For example, if you're using Mocha and Istanbul, your script might look like this:

     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "test": "nyc mocha"
     }
     ```

     Then, run your tests with coverage:

     ```bash
     npm test
     ```

3. **Generate SonarQube Compatible Report:**
   - Convert the coverage report generated by your tool into a format compatible with SonarQube. For Istanbul, you can use the `istanbul-sonarqube-instrumenter`:

     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev istanbul-sonarqube-instrumenter
     ```

     After running your tests, use the instrumenter to generate the SonarQube-compatible report:

     ```bash
     nyc report --reporter=lcov
     istanbul-sonarqube-instrumenter
     ```

4. **Run SonarScanner:**
   - Use the SonarScanner to analyze your project and send the coverage report to SonarQube. Modify your `sonar-project.properties` file accordingly:

     ```properties
     sonar.projectKey=my-project
     sonar.projectName=My Project
     sonar.sources=src
     sonar.tests=test
     sonar.javascript.lcov.reportPaths=coverage/lcov-report/*.lcov
     ```

     Run SonarScanner:

     ```bash
     sonar-scanner
     ```

5. **View Results in SonarQube:**
   - Open your SonarQube dashboard to view the analysis results, including code coverage metrics.

### Note:
- Make sure to customize the commands and configurations based on your project setup and testing framework.
- The commands and tools mentioned here are just examples; you may need to adapt them depending on your specific project and preferences.

Always refer to the official documentation for the tools you are using and the SonarQube documentation for the most accurate and up-to-date information.
