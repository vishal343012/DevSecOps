# NEXUS3

Nexus 3 is a popular artifact repository manager used in software development and DevOps workflows. It is designed to store and manage binary artifacts such as JAR files, Docker images, npm packages, and more. Nexus 3 is developed by Sonatype and provides a centralized location for teams to store, retrieve, and manage dependencies and artifacts in a secure and efficient manner. Below, I'll explain the key features and components of Nexus 3 in detail:

1. **Artifact Repository Manager**:
   - Nexus 3 primarily functions as an artifact repository manager, allowing organizations to store and manage various types of binary artifacts. These artifacts can include libraries, dependencies, and build outputs required for software development projects.

2. **Support for Multiple Repository Formats**:
   - Nexus 3 supports a wide range of repository formats, including:
     - **Maven**: For Java-based projects, Maven Central compatibility.
     - **Docker**: Container images and registries.
     - **npm**: Node.js package manager for JavaScript and Node.js projects.
     - **NuGet**: Package manager for .NET applications.
     - **Raw**: Generic storage for any binary format.
     - **Yum**: For RPM package management in Linux environments.
     - **PyPI**: Python package manager repository support.

3. **Proxy and Caching**:
   - Nexus 3 allows you to set up proxy repositories that cache external repositories like Maven Central or Docker Hub. This feature improves build performance by reducing the need to repeatedly download dependencies from external sources.

4. **Hosting Private Repositories**:
   - Nexus 3 enables organizations to host private repositories to store their proprietary or custom artifacts. This is essential for managing internal libraries and ensuring data security.

5. **Search and Indexing**:
   - Nexus 3 provides robust search capabilities, making it easy to find and retrieve artifacts quickly. It indexes repositories, allowing you to search for artifacts by name, version, and other metadata.

6. **Security and Access Control**:
   - Nexus 3 includes fine-grained access control features. You can define roles and permissions to restrict or grant access to specific users or groups, ensuring that sensitive artifacts are protected.

7. **Integration with CI/CD Tools**:
   - Nexus 3 integrates seamlessly with popular CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) tools like Jenkins, Travis CI, and CircleCI. This integration ensures that artifacts are automatically published and retrieved during the build and deployment processes.

8. **Lifecycle Management**:
   - Nexus 3 supports the management of artifact lifecycles. You can define retention policies, promote artifacts through different stages (e.g., from development to production), and track the history of changes.

9. **Repository Health and Monitoring**:
   - It provides monitoring and reporting features to track repository health, performance, and usage. You can identify storage issues and optimize your repository manager accordingly.

10. **RESTful API**:
    - Nexus 3 offers a RESTful API that allows you to automate various tasks, such as uploading and downloading artifacts, configuring repositories, and managing permissions.

11. **High Availability and Scalability**:
    - Nexus 3 can be set up in a high-availability configuration for improved reliability. It can scale horizontally to handle increased artifact storage and retrieval demands.

12. **User-Friendly Web Interface**:
    - Nexus 3 includes a web-based user interface that makes it easy to manage repositories, configure settings, and perform administrative tasks.

13. **Plugin Ecosystem**:
    - Nexus 3 has a plugin system that allows you to extend its functionality to meet specific requirements or integrate with other tools and systems.

In summary, Nexus 3 is a powerful artifact repository manager that plays a crucial role in modern software development and DevOps pipelines. It offers features for artifact storage, caching, security, and integration with various development tools, making it an essential component of many software development environments.


# STEPS

```markdown
# NEXUS3 INSTALLATION by shell commands

sudo apt install openjdk-8-jdk -y

cd /opt
wget https://download.sonatype.com/nexus/3/nexus-3.59.0-01-unix.tar.gz
tar -xvf nexus-3.59.0-01-unix.tar.gz

# Create user nexus

adduser nexus

chown -R nexus:nexus nexus-3.59.0-01/
chown -R nexus:nexus sonatype-work/

vi nexus-3.59.0-01/bin/nexus.rc
in ""  put nexus  --->"nexus"

/opt/nexus-3.59.0-01/bin/nexus start
```

### Installation usinh Docker (Easy Way)

To install Nexus 3 using Docker and retrieve the initial admin password, you can use the following shell commands:

### 1. Install Nexus 3 Using Docker:

```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:8081 --name nexus sonatype/nexus3
```

This command pulls the Nexus 3 Docker image from the official Sonatype repository and runs it as a detached container (`-d`). It exposes the Nexus web interface on host port 8081 (`-p 8081:8081`) and names the container "nexus."

### 2. Retrieve the Initial Admin Password:

Wait for Nexus to start, and then retrieve the initial admin password. You can do this by checking the logs or using the following command:

```bash
docker ps
# note down container_ID
docker exec -it container_ID /bin/bash
# cat sonatype-work/nexus3/admin.password
```

This command uses `docker exec` to execute a command inside the running "nexus" container. The command `cat /nexus-data/admin.password` prints the initial admin password to the terminal.

### 3. Access Nexus 3 Web Interface:

Open a web browser and go to `http://localhost:8081`. Log in with the username "admin" and the password retrieved in the previous step.

**Note:** Make sure to wait for Nexus 3 to fully initialize before attempting to retrieve the admin password.

### Cleanup (Optional):

If you want to stop and remove the Nexus 3 Docker container after testing, you can use the following commands:

```bash
docker stop nexus
docker rm nexus
```

These commands stop and remove the "nexus" container.

Remember to adjust the Docker commands based on your specific requirements and environment. Additionally, ensure that Docker is installed and configured on your system before running these commands.
