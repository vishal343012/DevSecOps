## Trivy Usage Guide

Trivy is a powerful vulnerability scanner for containers and filesystems. This guide will walk you through the various ways to use Trivy for scanning folders and Docker images.

#### Folder Scan

To scan a folder or directory for vulnerabilities, use the following command:

```bash
trivy fs path_to_scan
```

Example:

```bash
trivy fs /path/to/scan
```

To save the scan result in HTML format, use the `--format` and `-o` options:

```bash
trivy fs --format html -o result.html path_to_scan
```

Example:

```bash
trivy fs --format html -o result.html /path/to/scan
```

You can also specify the types of security checks to perform using the `--security-checks` option:

```bash
trivy fs --format html -o result.html --security-checks vuln,config Folder_name_OR_Path
```

#### Docker Image Scan

To scan a Docker image for vulnerabilities, use the following command:

```bash
trivy image image_name
```

Example:

```bash
trivy image my_image:latest
```

To save the scan result in HTML format, use the `-f` and `-o` options:

```bash
trivy image -f html -o results.html image_name
```

Example:

```bash
trivy image -f html -o results.html my_image:latest
```

You can specify the severity levels of vulnerabilities to include in the report using the `--severity` option:

```bash
trivy image -f html -o results.htm --severity HIGH,CRITICAL image_name
```

Example:

```bash
trivy image -f html -o results.html --severity HIGH,CRITICAL my_image:latest
```
