# SetUp Tomcat & Deploy To it

## 9.0.65

**1. Installing Apache Tomcat:**

```bash
sudo su
```
This command switches to the superuser account for performing administrative tasks.

```bash
cd /opt
```
Navigate to the `/opt` directory where Apache Tomcat will be installed.

```bash
sudo wget https://archive.apache.org/dist/tomcat/tomcat-9/v9.0.65/bin/apache-tomcat-9.0.65.tar.gz
```
Download the Apache Tomcat 9 distribution archive.

```bash
sudo tar -xvf apache-tomcat-9.0.65.tar.gz
```
Extract the downloaded archive file.

**2. Configuring Tomcat Users:**

```bash
cd /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/conf
```
Navigate to the `conf` directory within the Tomcat installation directory.

```bash
sudo vi tomcat-users.xml
```
Open the `tomcat-users.xml` file for editing.

Add the following line as the second-last line in the file:
```xml
<user username="admin" password="admin1234" roles="admin-gui, manager-gui, manager-script"/>
```
This line adds a user with the username "admin" and password "admin1234" with roles allowing access to the administrative GUI and manager scripts.

**3. Creating Symbolic Links for Startup and Shutdown Scripts:**

```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/bin/startup.sh /usr/bin/startTomcat
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/bin/stopTomcat
```
Create symbolic links to the `startup.sh` and `shutdown.sh` scripts in the Tomcat bin directory, allowing easy access to start and stop Tomcat from anywhere in the terminal.

**4. Configuring Access Control for Manager and Host-Manager Applications:**

```bash
sudo vi /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
```
Open the `context.xml` file for the manager web application.

Comment out the following lines:
```xml
<!-- Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
```
This disables the RemoteAddrValve, which restricts access based on IP addresses.

```bash
sudo vi /opt/apache-tomcat-9.0.65/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
```
Open the `context.xml` file for the host-manager web application.

Comment out the following lines:
```xml
<!-- Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" /> -->
```
Similar to the manager application, this disables the RemoteAddrValve for host-manager as well.

**5. Starting and Stopping Tomcat:**

```bash
sudo stopTomcat
```
Stop the Tomcat server.

```bash
sudo startTomcat
```
Start the Tomcat server.

Following these steps, you should have successfully installed Apache Tomcat 9 on your Linux system, configured user authentication, created symbolic links for easy access to startup and shutdown scripts, and configured access control for the manager and host-manager web applications.

## 10.1.20

**Step 1: Switch to Superuser**

```bash
sudo su
```

This command switches the current user to the superuser, granting elevated privileges necessary for system-wide operations.

**Step 2: Navigate to the Opt Directory**

```bash
cd /opt
```

This command changes the current directory to `/opt`, where optional software packages are often installed.

**Step 3: Download Apache Tomcat 10.1.20**

```bash
sudo wget https://dlcdn.apache.org/tomcat/tomcat-10/v10.1.20/bin/apache-tomcat-10.1.20.tar.gz
```

This command uses `wget` to download the Apache Tomcat 10.1.20 tarball from the official Apache Tomcat website.

**Step 4: Extract the Apache Tomcat Tarball**

```bash
sudo tar -xvf apache-tomcat-10.1.20.tar.gz
```

This command extracts the contents of the downloaded tarball into a directory named `apache-tomcat-10.1.20`.

**Step 5: Navigate to the Tomcat Configuration Directory**

```bash
cd /opt/apache-tomcat-10.1.20/conf
```

This command changes the current directory to the `conf` directory within the extracted Tomcat directory.

**Step 6: Edit the Tomcat Users Configuration File**

```bash
sudo vi tomcat-users.xml
```

This command opens the `tomcat-users.xml` file using the `vi` text editor with superuser privileges for editing.

Add the following line before the closing `</tomcat-users>` tag:

```xml
<user username="admin" password="admin1234" roles="admin-gui, manager-gui, manager-script"/>
```

This line adds a user with the username "admin" and password "admin1234" to the Tomcat user database with roles that grant access to the administrative interfaces.

**Step 7: Create Symbolic Links for Start and Stop Commands**

```bash
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-10.1.20/bin/startup.sh /usr/bin/startTomcat
sudo ln -s /opt/apache-tomcat-10.1.20/bin/shutdown.sh /usr/bin/stopTomcat
```

These commands create symbolic links named `startTomcat` and `stopTomcat` in the `/usr/bin` directory, pointing to the respective startup and shutdown scripts in the Tomcat installation directory. This enables easy execution of start and stop commands from any directory in the terminal.

**Step 8: Configure Tomcat Manager Context**

```bash
sudo vi /opt/apache-tomcat-10.1.20/webapps/manager/META-INF/context.xml
```

This command opens the `context.xml` file for editing, which configures the context for the Tomcat Manager web application.

Comment out the following lines by adding `<!--` at the beginning and `-->` at the end:

```xml
<!-- Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" / -->
```

This disables the remote address valve, allowing access to the Tomcat Manager interface from any IP address.

**Step 9: Configure Host Manager Context**

```bash
sudo vi /opt/apache-tomcat-10.1.20/webapps/host-manager/META-INF/context.xml
```

This command opens the `context.xml` file for editing, which configures the context for the Tomcat Host Manager web application.

Comment out the following lines by adding `<!--` at the beginning and `-->` at the end:

```xml
<!-- Valve className="org.apache.catalina.valves.RemoteAddrValve"
  allow="127\.\d+\.\d+\.\d+|::1|0:0:0:0:0:0:0:1" / -->
```

This disables the remote address valve, allowing access to the Host Manager interface from any IP address.

**Step 10: Start and Stop Tomcat**

```bash
sudo stopTomcat
sudo startTomcat
```

These commands utilize the symbolic links created earlier to easily start and stop the Tomcat server. `stopTomcat` shuts down the Tomcat server, while `startTomcat` starts it up again.
